# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CICD

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on: [push]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # The "build" workflow
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
