# This workflow runs when the master branch changes. A new Docker image will be built
# for both the Frontend and the Backend, and they will be pushed to Docker Hub
# with the 'staging' tag.

# Then an Ansible playbokk will be executed on the staging server
# to update the service with these new images.
